Solution:
class Solution:
    def stringStack(self, pat, tar):
        i, j = len(pat) - 1, len(tar) - 1

        while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
            if pat[i] == tar[j]:
                # match, move both
                i -= 1
                j -= 1
            else:

                i -= 2
        
        # If tar is fully matched
        return j < 0
